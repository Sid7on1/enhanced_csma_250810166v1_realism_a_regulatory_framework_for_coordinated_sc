However, the blooming of shared mi-\ncromobility vehicles brings some social problems to the city (e.g.,\noverloaded vehicles on roads, and the inequity of vehicle deploy-\nment), which deviate from the city regulator\u2019s expectation of the\nservice of the shared micromobility system. In addition, the multi-\noperator shared micromobility system in a city complicates the\nproblem because of their non-cooperative self-interested pursuits.\nExisting regulatory frameworks of multi-operator vehicle rebalanc-\ning generally assume the intrusive control of vehicle rebalancing\nof all the operators, which is not practical in the real world. To ad-\ndress this limitation, we design REALISM, a regulatory framework\nfor coordinated scheduling in multi-operator shared micromobility\nservices that incorporates the city regulator\u2019s regulations in the\nform of assigning a score to each operator according to the city goal\nachievements and operators\u2019 individual contributions to achieving\nthe city goal, measured by Shapley value. To realize the fairness-\naware score assignment, we measure the fairness of assigned scores\nand use them as one of the components to optimize the score as-\nsignment model. To optimize the whole framework, we develop\nan alternating procedure to make operators and the city regulator\ninteract with each other until convergence. We evaluate our frame-\nwork based on real-world e-scooter usage data in Chicago. Our\nexperiment results show that our method achieves a performance\ngain of at least 39.93 %in the equity of vehicle usage and 1.82 %in\nthe average demand satisfaction of the whole city.\nCCS Concepts\n\u2022Applied computing \u2192Transportation ;\u2022Computing method-\nologies\u2192Planning and scheduling .\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the first page.

In 33rd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Con-\nference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (SIGSPATIAL \u201925),\nNovember 3 \u2013 6, 2025, Minneapolis, MN, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA,\n11 pages.\n1 Introduction\nShared micromobility (e.g., shared bikes and scooters) has emerged\nas a popular mode of urban transportation worldwide. For instance,\nby 2023, 207 cities in the United States have already deployed shared\nmicromobility systems [ 23]. In place of conventional cars, shared\nmicromobility offers a more efficient and eco-friendly mode of short\ntrips, such as commuting from leaving subway stations for work-\nplaces [ 41\u201343]. Service operators routinely (e.g., daily) redistribute\nvehicles across different areas to align supply with demand. How-\never, the blooming of shared micromobility vehicles introduces\nseveral problems to cities, such as overloaded vehicles on roads and\nspatial inequity of vehicle deployment [ 4,13], which deviates from\ncity expectations such as enhancing accessibility [21]. In addition,\nthe shared micromobility system managed by multiple operators\nin a city (e.g., more than three operators in Chicago [ 6]) further\ncomplicates those problems because it is challenging for cities to\ncoordinate these operators when the operators have their own\nprofit goals [ 1]. In this work, we use electric scooters (e-scooters)\nas an example to study the problem of how to incorporate city\nregulations (e.g., equity requirements and demand satisfaction) into\nshared micromobility vehicle scheduling.\nThe literature on multi-fleet management generally falls into\ntwo categories: (i) cooperative management [ 19,25,31,38] and\n(ii) non-cooperative management [ 15,17,34,37]. In the coopera-\ntive paradigm, some studies assume that all fleets share a common\nobjective and work collectively to achieve it [ 31]. However, this\nassumption is often unrealistic in practice, as micromobility opera-\ntors pursue different goals driven by their own profit incentives [ 1],\nlimiting the applicability of such cooperative frameworks. Other\ncooperative approaches rely on a centralized controller [ 12] to coor-\ndinate vehicles from multiple operators. This setup faces practicalarXiv:2508.10166v1  [cs.MA]  13 Aug 2025\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nSIGSPATIAL \u201925, November 3 \u2013 6, 2025, Minneapolis, MN, USA Heng Tan, Hua Yan, Yukun Yuan, Guang Wang, and Yu Yang\nbarriers: operators may be unwilling to comply with centralized\ndirectives and typically prefer to retain control over their fleets.\nMoreover, a centralized control agent introduces a large action and\nstate space, making the problem computationally challenging. In\ncontrast, non-cooperative frameworks model each fleet as oper-\nating independently with its own objectives, without centralized\ncoordination [ 34]. While this setup reflects current practices more\naccurately, it precludes communication and cooperation between\noperators, making it difficult to achieve system-level outcomes\nthat align with policy goals. Although some real-world interven-\ntions [ 7,21] enforce regulations through strict rules (e.g., requiring\na minimum number of vehicles in specific areas), these measures\nstill fall short of meeting city-wide goals, as shown in Sec. 2.\nIn our work, we design a novel approach to align the objec-\ntives of micromobility operators with broader city goals through\na non-intrusive, collaborative mechanism. We position the city\nregulator as a facilitator who interacts with these operators to iden-\ntify optimal scheduling strategies that are aligned with city goals.\nThis process involves operators continuously optimizing their fleet\nscheduling to maximize profitability, while the city regulator pro-\nvides feedback that nudges their strategies toward city-wide goals.\nThis feedback loop encourages operators to adjust their decisions\nwithout requiring direct control or intervention. This iterative pro-\ncess of adaptation and feedback facilitates a dynamic refinement\nof both the operators\u2019 scheduling actions and the city regulatory\napproaches. Importantly, our mechanism allows the regulator to\nguide operator behavior solely through feedback, without access\nto the internal details (e.g., network structure or parameters) of\ntheir scheduling models. This preserves business confidentiality\nand supports practical deployment. The goal is to establish a syner-\ngistic environment where micromobility services are optimized for\nboth operator profitability and public objectives, such as promoting\ngeographic equity and satisfying region-level demand [7].\nWe face two challenges in achieving our goal. Firstly, although\nmicromobility operators are expected to comply with city regula-\ntions (such as those enforced in cities like Chicago, where violations\nmay lead to permit suspension [ 7]), the non-cooperative relation-\nship between operators makes them unwilling to share real-time\ngeographic vehicle locations and trip records with each other due\nto privacy and business competition. As a result, each operator\ndesigns its scheduling policy based solely on its own observations.\nSecondly, in current practice, operators are typically required to\nshare only limited information, such as vehicle locations, with city\nregulators [ 21], without disclosing detailed model parameters or\nimplementation details. This makes it difficult for the regulator to\ngenerate effective feedback. Moreover, designing a fair feedback\nmechanism is itself a challenge. Since the feedback may affect each\noperator\u2019s ability to maximize profit, it is critical to ensure that the\nmechanism does not disproportionately advantage or disadvantage\nany individual operator, as our evaluation later demonstrates.\nWe design REALISM, a regulatory framework for coordinated\nschedu ling in multi-operator shared micromobility services. In our\nframework, we assume that each operator uses a scheduler built on\na state-of-the-art algorithm, such as a Multi-Agent Reinforcement\nLearning (MARL) vehicle scheduling framework [ 30,31], trained on\nits own data to maximize profit. To guide these schedulers toward\ncity-wide goals, we introduce a regulation network that evaluatesthe joint actions of all operators with respect to city regulations.\nIt assigns individual rewards (positive or negative) to each oper-\nator based on their relative contributions to the city\u2019s objectives.\nTo comprehensively measure the operators\u2019 region-level contribu-\ntions, we introduce the Shapley value [ 10,28], which provides a\nprincipled way to attribute the collective achievement of city goals\nto individual operators. To ensure fairness in feedback, we incorpo-\nrate multiple fairness metrics into the regulation network as a core\ncomponent. We further develop an adaptive alternating optimiza-\ntion procedure, allowing operator schedulers and the regulation\nmodel to iteratively interact and co-adapt until convergence. The\nkey contributions of this work are as follows:\n(1) To our best knowledge, we are the first to approach the prob-\nlem of multi-operator vehicle scheduling with city non-intrusive\nregulations. It enables no shared information between operators\nand uses a feedback mechanism for regulators to guide the individ-\nual operators\u2019 scheduling.\n(2) Technically, we design a regulatory framework for coordi-\nnated scheduling in multi-operator shared micromobility services.\nSpecifically, the regulator scores the operators\u2019 rebalancing strate-\ngies and offers different rewards to them according to the city goal\nachievement and the operators\u2019 contribution, which is measured\nby the Shapley value of each operator. In addition, we develop an\nalternating procedure to make operators and the city regulator\ninteract with each other to optimize the whole framework.\n(3) We evaluate our framework based on real-world e-scooter us-\nage data in Chicago. Our experiment results show that our method\nachieves a performance gain of at least 39.93 %in the equity of\nvehicle usage and 1.82 %in the average demand satisfaction of the\nwhole city, compared to state-of-the-art baselines. On average, our\nmethod improves the equity of vehicle usage by 81.11 %and the\naverage demand satisfaction by 9.84 %compared to those baselines.\n2 Preliminary and Motivation\nIn this section, we first introduce the shared micromobility opera-\ntion data. Then we motivate our work by analyzing the importance\nof city regulations on vehicle scheduling.\nTable 1: Samples in the dataset\nTrip ID Start Time End Time Trip Distance (m)\nT001 5/28/2022 14:00 5/28/2022 15:00 2,484\nTrip Duration (s) Start Region End Region Vehicle Operator\n1,544 -87.62519, 41.87887 -87.62520 41.87886 Lime\n2.1 Data Description\nWe use a public real-world dataset collected by the Chicago gov-\nernment [ 6] from 3 operators (Lime, Spin, and Bird) spanning four\nmonths from June 2022 to September 2022 with over 629,934 trips.\nThe dataset includes the trip duration, trip distance, vehicle op-\nerator, start time, start region, and other relevant information (as\nshown in Table 1). The Chicago regulator (e.g., the transportation\ndepartment) periodically gathers this information from operators.\n2.2 Why City Regulations Are Important?\nCity Regulations : One objective of the city regulator is to achieve\nthe city goals through regulations. For example, in Chicago, the\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nREALISM: A Regulatory Multi-Operator Shared Micromobility Vehicle Scheduling Framework SIGSPATIAL \u201925, November 3 \u2013 6, 2025, Minneapolis, MN, USA\ncity regulator requires shared micromobility operators to ensure\nvehicle usage equity by maintaining a minimum number of vehicles\nin high-priority regions [ 7] and maximizing the demand satisfac-\ntion rates of all areas [ 21]. In our work, the demand satisfaction\nrate is defined as the average ratio of satisfied demand to total\ndemand across all regions per day. We assume that the number of\ntrips recorded in the dataset is the total demand (this is commonly\nused as a reasonable approximation in existing works [ 15,31,34]\nwhen the actual demand is generally unknown). The vehicle usage\nequity is the difference in supply-demand ratios between individual\nregions and the whole city (detailed formulation in Section 3). A\ncommon city regulation is to define areas of a city with high prior-\nity, considering both demand satisfaction and vehicle usage equity,\nand instruct operators to relocate a fixed proportion of vehicles to\nthose areas [7].\nObservations : Our research is built upon the hypothesis that\ncity regulations of vehicle scheduling are effective in fulfilling city\ngoals.s We examine the hypothesis by evaluating the achievement\nof the above city goals when applying scheduling methods with and\nwithout the implementation of city regulations based on the data in\nChicago. Based on the Chicago regulations [ 31], we relocate half of\neach operator\u2019s fleet to priority regions. Then, operators rebalance\ntheir remaining fleets based on their policies. Figures 1 and 2 show\nthe distributions of daily demand satisfaction rate and vehicle usage\nequity, jointly across three operators, in all 77 regions of the city\nover one month. The red dashed line indicates the quantified city\ngoal in Chicago [7].\n/uni0000005a/uni00000012/uni00000052/uni00000003/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni0000004a/uni00000058/uni0000004f/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051 /uni0000005a/uni00000003/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni0000004a/uni00000058/uni0000004f/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051/uni00000019/uni00000013/uni0000001a/uni00000013/uni0000001b/uni00000013/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013 /uni00000036/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000056/uni00000049/uni00000044/uni00000046/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051/uni00000003/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni0000000b/uni00000008/uni0000000c\nFigure 1: Distribution of daily\ndemand satisfaction rate\n/uni0000005a/uni00000012/uni00000052/uni00000003/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni0000004a/uni00000058/uni0000004f/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051 /uni0000005a/uni00000003/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni0000004a/uni00000058/uni0000004f/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051/uni00000013\n/uni0000001a/uni00000018\n/uni00000014/uni00000018/uni00000013\n/uni00000015/uni00000015/uni00000018\n/uni00000016/uni00000013/uni00000013\n/uni00000028/uni00000054/uni00000058/uni0000004c/uni00000057/uni0000005c\nFigure 2: Distribution of daily\nvehicle usage equity\nAs shown in Figure 1, with regulation, the whole city can achieve\na higher average demand satisfaction rate than that without regu-\nlation. Then, Figure 2 shows that vehicle usage equity significantly\nfalls below the city goal without regulation. However, even if the\nregulation is applied to each operator, the improvement is marginal.\nIn addition, we find that the current city regulations (simply adding\nrestrictions to each operator) undermine the operators\u2019 profits; for\nexample, the net revenue of the operators Lime, Spin, and Bird\ndecreased by 2.6 %, 3.3%, and 4.4 %respectively in our study. This\nimplies that the operators\u2019 goal of maximizing their profits does not\ncoincide with the city goal of maximizing the demand satisfaction\nrate due to the profit differences in trips. Therefore, the above re-\nsults motivate us to develop a more effective method to regulate all\noperators to satisfy city goals while optimizing operators\u2019 profits.\n3 Problem Formulation\nIn this section, we formulate the problem of shared micromobility\nvehicle scheduling under regulations.Problem Setting : We partition a city into \ud835\udc41regions according\nto the community divisions of the city [ 6]. A day is divided into\n\ud835\udc47equal-length time intervals. In the city, there are \ud835\udc40operators\nthat provide shared micromobility services. To describe the spatial-\ntemporal distribution of vehicles in a city, we use \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61to denote\nthe number of vehicles of operator \ud835\udc5ain region\ud835\udc56at the beginning of\ntime slot\ud835\udc61for1\u2264\ud835\udc56\u2264\ud835\udc41,1\u2264\ud835\udc5a\u2264\ud835\udc40. We use\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61to denote user\ndemand, which quantifies the number of user requests of operator \ud835\udc5a\nfrom region \ud835\udc56to region\ud835\udc57within the time slot \ud835\udc61. Therefore, for each\noperator, we can define the vehicle distribution and user requests\nof the whole city at time slot \ud835\udc61as\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61\u2208N\ud835\udc41(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61={\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61}\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5a), and\n\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61\u2208N\ud835\udc41\u00d7\ud835\udc41(\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61={\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61}\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc5a).\nScheduling : In order to meet the highest possible number of fu-\nture user requests, it is essential for operators to rebalance vehicles.\nWe define\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61\u2208N\ud835\udc41\u00d7\ud835\udc41(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61={\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61}1\u2264\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57\u2264\ud835\udc41)as the rebalancing\nstrategy of operator \ud835\udc5aat the beginning of time slot \ud835\udc61, and\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61rep-\nresents the number of vehicles of operator \ud835\udc5ato be rebalanced from\nregion\ud835\udc56to\ud835\udc57at the beginning of time slot \ud835\udc61. To efficiently rebalance\nvehicles, operators should consider current vehicle distribution and\nuser demand of future \u210etime slots. Hence, the rebalancing strategy\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61is formulated as:\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61=\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4f(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61:\ud835\udc61+\u210e). (1)\nAfter determining rebalancing actions, the staff of each operator\nfollow those actions and rebalance the vehicles by trucks. We define\nrebalancing costs \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4f,\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61of each operator \ud835\udc5aat time slot \ud835\udc61as:\n\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4f,\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61=\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4f(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61). (2)\nWe use\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61to represent the trip revenue at time slot \ud835\udc61, which is\nrelated to the vehicle distribution, user demand, and rebalancing\nactions of operator \ud835\udc5aat time slot \ud835\udc61and formulate it as:\n\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61=\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61). (3)\nWe list the calculation details of trip revenue and truck-based\nrebalancing costs in the evaluation section (see Section 5).\nCity Goals : The city regulator aims to realize specific social\nobjectives by overseeing the regulation of shared micromobility\nvehicles throughout the city. In our study, we use Chicago as an ex-\nample and identify two primary goals from the city regulations [ 22],\nwhich include (1) ensuring equitable vehicle usage across different\ncommunities, and (2) maximizing user demand satisfaction in all\nareas. It is worth noting that other goals can also be incorporated\ninto our framework with minimal modifications to our method. Mo-\ntivated by [ 9,20], we define the equity of vehicle usage across the\nregions of a city as the difference between the region-level demand-\nsupply ratio ( \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61) and the city-level demand-supply ratio (i.e.,\u00cd\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc56\u2032=1\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56\u2032\n\ud835\udc61/\u00cd\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc56\u2032=1\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\u2032\n\ud835\udc61), formulated as:\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc62\n\ud835\udc61=\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1\u2212\f\f\f\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61\u2212\u00cd\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc56\u2032=1\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56\u2032\n\ud835\udc61\u00cd\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc56\u2032=1\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\u2032\n\ud835\udc61\f\f\f, (4)\nwhere\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61is the number of vehicles in region \ud835\udc56at time slot \ud835\udc61.

This\nframework consists of three components: the environment, shared\nmicromobility operators, and a city regulator. (1) Environment: It\nsimulates the shared micromobility system operations. (2) Shared\nmicromobility operators: In our work, we assume that users rely\non a single operator\u2014they do not switch between operators when\ntheir preferred operator has insufficient supply. Each operator is as-\nsumed to utilize a neural network-based scheduling model and learn\nhow to schedule its own vehicles in the city to maximize the net rev-\nenue, determined by the balance between satisfied user demand and\nrebalancing costs. Specifically, we assign a neural network-based\nagent for each operator in a region to make rebalancing decisions\nconsidering the vehicle distribution and future user demand. Therebalancing strategies are then executed by trucks that move vehi-\ncles between communities. (3) City regulator: In practice, cities\nlike Chicago regulate shared micromobility by requiring operators\nto share a real-time data API [ 7]. Incentives and penalties\u2014such as\n(i) suspending operations for up to 30 days and (ii) adjusting fleet\nsizes based on performance\u2014are imposed based on the regulator-\ndefined shared micromobility service metrics, such as [ 7], which\nhave direct financial implications for operators. Therefore, in the\ncity regulator\u2019s component, we consider the city regulator as a\ntrusted entity to which operators share real-time mobility data\nand assess the progress toward meeting the city goals. Then, the\ncity regulator offers a financial score, which can be either negative\n(penalty) or positive (incentive), to each operator, taking into ac-\ncount their respective contributions to the fulfillment of the city\ngoals. In our study, we design a fairness-aware score assignment\nmodel that processes inputs such as the city goal achievements,\neach operator\u2019s contribution towards these goals, and the daily net\nrevenue of the operators. The model outputs a score and assigns it\nto the reward for each operator to update its rebalancing agents.\nThrough the implementation of fairness-aware score assignments,\nwe expect operators to collaboratively fulfill the city goals while\nalso optimizing their profits.\n4.2 Multi-agent RL-based Vehicle Scheduling\nMotivated by the advancement of vehicle scheduling methods [ 31,\n34], we model the problem of rebalancing vehicles for each operator\nas a Markov Decision Process for \ud835\udc41agents expressed as a tuple\n({S,A,R,P,\ud835\udefe}).Sdenotes the set of states.

The\ndefinitions of these notations are as follows:\nAgent : We define an agent for each region in the city, which\ndecides how to rebalance the vehicles in a region. Instead of uti-\nlizing a single agent to control the vehicles for the entire city, we\nuse centralized training and decentralized execution to reduce the\ncomputational complexity [9, 18].\nState : At the beginning of each time slot \ud835\udc61, the state of region \ud835\udc56\nis defined as \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61={\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c,\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc59\n\ud835\udc61}, where the local state \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c,\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61contains the\nnumber of vehicles \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61and future\u210etime-slot user demand \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61:\ud835\udc61+\u210e\n(\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61:\ud835\udc61+\u210e={\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc61:\ud835\udc61+\u210e}\ud835\udc57)in region\ud835\udc56at the beginning of time slot \ud835\udc61.

The future\ndemand is predicted by a pre-trained prediction model [31].\nAction : Given the above state, the agent in region \ud835\udc56at the begin-\nning of time slot \ud835\udc61decides the number of vehicles to be rebalanced\nfrom region \ud835\udc56to\ud835\udc57, denoted as \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61={\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc61}1\u2264\ud835\udc57\u2264\ud835\udc41).\nReward : Since all the region agents collaboratively maximize\nthe operator profit, they share the same reward.

In our work, city regulators take into\naccount three critical factors when determining score assignments:\nthe extent of city goal achievements, the varied contributions of\ndifferent operators towards these goals, and the respective net\nrevenues of these operators.\nCity goal achievement : We evaluate the city goal achievement\nby comparing the city\u2019s micromobility status at each time slot with\nthe specified requirements of city goals. This measurement is based\non Eq. (6) and is formulated as follows:\n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc61=\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\u22121\n\ud835\udc41\u00b7\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61;\n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc62\n\ud835\udc61=\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc62\u2212\ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1\u2212\f\f\f\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61\u2212\u00cd\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc56\u2032=1\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc56\u2032\n\ud835\udc61\u00cd\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc56\u2032=1\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\u2032\n\ud835\udc61\f\f\f,(9)\nwhere\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc61and\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc62\n\ud835\udc61represent the distance between the achieved\ndemand satisfaction and vehicle usage equity at time slot \ud835\udc61, and the\ncity goals (i.e., \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61and\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc62), respectively.\nOperator contribution : Due to variations in vehicle distribu-\ntion and user demand across different operators, merely assessing\nan operator\u2019s contribution to city goals through Eq. (5)for satisfac-\ntion and Eq. (4)for equity does not accurately capture the operator\u2019s\ntrue impact. Inspired by foundational works in coalitional game\ntheory [ 10,28], we employ the Shapley value as a metric to quantify\neach operator\u2019s individual contribution. We conceptualize the cal-\nculation of an operator\u2019s contribution as a game involving multiple\noperators. We denote the set of operators participating in this game\nasM:={1,...,\ud835\udc40}. Within this framework, operators have the po-\ntential to form various coalitions, exemplified by subsets of Msuch\nas{1,2}.

In this task, operators\nwill interact with the regulator: agents of each operator rebalance\nvehicles according to their policies, and the city regulator assigns\na score to each operator based on the city goal achievements and\noperators\u2019 contributions, affecting operators\u2019 reward functions. The\noperators\u2019 trajectories are stored in a data buffer.\nTask 2: Update operator agents: Given a fixed fairness-aware\nscore assignment model, we update the operators\u2019 agents through\na standard reinforcement learning updating scheme. During each\ntraining iteration, we collect actions, states, and rewards from the\nregion agents to update their policies by existing gradient policy\nupdate methods [5, 18].\nTask 3: Update the fairness-aware score assignment model:\nAfter updating the operator agents, we proceed to update the score\nassignment model. In this task, we replay the interaction from task 2\nwith the same initial state but using the updated operators\u2019 policies,\nfor further assessment. As this model influences the rebalancing\npolicy updates, which in turn affects both the city goal achievement\nand the operators\u2019 profits, we assess the effectiveness of the scores\nfrom two perspectives by replaying the iteration: (i) whether the\nrebalancing policy updates guided by the scores move the outcomes\ncloser to the city goals, and (ii) whether the scores are fair to each\noperator. Thus, we supervise the model update with these two\nobjectives. For (i), we replay the iteration from step 1 with the\nsame initial state but use the updated rebalancing policie to collect\nnew data on city goal achievement, calculated as1\n\ud835\udc47\u00cd\n\ud835\udc61\u2032(\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc61\u2032+\n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc62\n\ud835\udc61\u2032), where T and \ud835\udc61\u2032denote the episode length and each time slot,\nrespectively. We use \ud835\udc61\u2032to distinguish it from the time slot \ud835\udc61in step 1.\nAn improvement in city goal achievement indicates that the score-\nguided rebalancing policy updates are more effectively aligned with\nthe city goals. For (ii), we use Equation 16 to measure the fairness\nof the scores assigned to operators. Consequently, the loss function\nused to update the score assignment model is represented as:\nL\ud835\udeff=\ud835\udefd1\n\ud835\udc47\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc61\u2032(\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc61\u2032+\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc62\n\ud835\udc61\u2032)+(1\u2212\ud835\udefd)1\n\ud835\udc47\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc61, (17)\nwhere\ud835\udefdis a significance weight.

We divide the dataset\ninto two parts: the data from the first two months serves as the\ntraining set, and the remaining data serves as the testing set. The\nentire city is partitioned into 77 regions based on the existing com-\nmunity divisions in the dataset. A day is divided into 24 hours,\nwith operators\u2019 rebalancing occurring every 12 hours. In our exper-\niments, we consider three operators (Lime, Spin, and Bird), with the\nnumber of vehicles from each operator being 2,695, 2,581, and 2,795,\nrespectively.

To simplify, we exclude\nthe labor cost from our calculations. In the test stage, we use the\nupdated operators\u2019 agents.\nWe implement our method and baselines with PyTorch 1.9.1,\nPython-mip 1.14.2, and gym 0.21.0 in a Python 3.7 environment,\nand we train them on a server equipped with 32 GB of memory and\na GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU. By testing the performances under\ndifferent hyperparameter settings, we use the following settings: For\noperator agents, we use a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with\na learning rate of 1e-4, determined to be optimal among [1e-3, 1e-4,\n1e-5]. City regulation learning employs an Adam optimizer with\nan optimal learning rate of 1e-3 from the same range. Exploration\nnoise is best at 0.1, tested among [0.05, 0.1, 0.2], with a minibatch\nsize of 32 for experience replay. The discount factor \ud835\udefeis set as 0.99.\nHyperparameters for other baselines are fine-tuned based on the\nrange in the original papers. Each operator\u2019s multi-agent vehicle\nscheduling model is pre-trained based on the existing work [ 31], and\nour regulatory framework for multi-operator vehicle scheduling\nconverged in 124 iterations.\n5.1.2 Baselines .We compare our method with the following base-\nlines and variants of our model:\n\u2022SDSM . It is a static demand-supply matching method where\neach operator rebalances the vehicles to each region based\non the ratio of the historical demand.\n\u2022RECOMMEND [31]. It is a state-of-the-art shared electric\nmicromobility vehicle rebalancing and charging algorithm.\nWe remove the components that involve charging while\nremaining the rebalancing components.\n\u2022ROCOMA [9]. It is a state-of-the-art shared electric vehicle\nrebalancing algorithm to minimize both the rebalancing costs\nand the inequities of vehicle usage and charging aross all\nregions.\n\u2022MAC-A2C [2]. It is a fully cooperative multi-agent rein-\nforcement learning framework adapted to collaboratively\nmaximize the achievement of city goals.\n\u2022Oracle . It represents the upper-bound performance where\nthe operators completely follow a trained centralized sched-\nuler [ 31] whose goal is to optimize the total revenue and thecity goal achievement jointly. Designing Oracle is to show\nthe gap between our method and the upper bound derived\nfrom an ideal (impractical) case.\nVariants of our model are as follows:\n\u2022REALISM without Regulation (w/o R) . In this setting, we\nremove the city regulator\u2019s regulation and let operators in\nthe city maximize their own profit without considering the\ncity goal achievement.\n\u2022REALISM without Fairness-Awareness Score Assign-\nment (w/o FASA) . In this setting, we remove the fairness\nevaluation of the city regulator\u2019s score assignment. The loss\nfunction of the score assignment prediction model only con-\nsiders the satisfaction rate.\n\u2022REALISM with Different Fairness Definitions (w DFD) .\nIn this setting, we utilize a different definition of fairness [ 11]\nfrom perspectives of both vehicle usage and score assign-\nment. Specifically, we use the difference between the local\ndemand satisfaction rate and the global demand satisfaction\nrate, and the difference between individual operator score\nand average operator score to respectively measure the ve-\nhicle usage equity and the fairness of score assignment.\n5.1.3 Metrics .The evaluation metrics are as follows:\n\u2022Average satisfaction rate : average satisfaction rate repre-\nsents the average ratio of satisfied demand to the total user\ndemand among all the regions (Equation 5).\n\u2022Net revenue : net revenue is the operator\u2019s trip revenue\nfrom satisfied user demand minus the rebalancing costs of\nthe relevant operator (Equation 8).\n\u2022Vehicle usage equity : vehicle usage equity measures the\ndifference between demand-supply ratios of individual re-\ngions and the whole city (Equation 4).\n5.2 Overall Performance\nTable 2 shows the overall performance of different methods, includ-\ning the model Oracle, which reflects the upper-bound performance\nof our model. From this analysis, we have the following findings:\n(1) Overall, our model REALISM consistently outperforms\nother state-of-the-art methods , achieving an improvement of\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nSIGSPATIAL \u201925, November 3 \u2013 6, 2025, Minneapolis, MN, USA Heng Tan, Hua Yan, Yukun Yuan, Guang Wang, and Yu Yang\nat least 39.93% in terms of vehicle usage equity and 1.82% in satis-\nfaction rate. (2) Compared with the city goal-aware baselines\n(i.e., ROCOMA and MAC-A2C) , REALISM significantly improves\noperators\u2019 net revenue. This indicates that the component of the\ncity regulator\u2019s regulation can guide operators\u2019 rebalancing from\na global perspective, enabling operators to provide more efficient\nand effective rebalancing strategies. Additionally, it is worth men-\ntioning that the improvement in demand satisfaction rate is not as\npronounced. This can be partially attributed to the profit differences\namong trips, suggesting that while operators strive to maximize net\nrevenue and satisfaction rates, higher profits from individual trips\ndo not necessarily translate to an increased demand satisfaction\nrate. (3) Compared with the baselines without considering\ncity goal achievements (i.e., SDSM and RECOMMEND) , RE-\nALISM shows superiority in improving vehicle usage equity due\nto its awareness of city goal achievements. (4) Compared with\nthe upper-bound model (i.e., Oracle) , our model achieves com-\nparably good performance. This demonstrates the advantage of our\nmethod under conditions where there is no information sharing\nbetween operators, making it practically useful. Even though Ora-\ncle achieves a higher performance, due to the competitive nature\nand data privacy concerns, it is generally considered an impractical\nsetting in reality.\n5.3 Ablation Study\n5.3.1 The Effectiveness of Regulation .To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the city regulator\u2019s regulation, we compare our\nmethod with the variant REALISM w/o R, as shown in Table 2.\nThe results show that without regulations, operators focus only on\nmaximizing their own profits, leading to poorer city goal achieve-\nment, which is similar to that of the model RECOMMEND. This\nunderscores the importance of the city regulation component in\nachieving city goals.\n5.3.2 The Effectiveness of Fairness Awareness in Score As-\nsignment .To demonstrate the effectiveness of fairness awareness\nin score assignment, we conduct comparison experiments with\nthe variant REALISM w/o FASA, as shown in Table 2. The results\nindicate that without fairness awareness in score assignment, the\ncity regulator\u2019s regulations can still promote better achievement\nof city goals compared to the baselines. We use a simple example\nto explain the reason: If achieving the city goal requires 100 %ef-\nfort, fairness only plays a role in how to distribute these efforts\namong the three operators based on their net revenue or fleet size.\nThis distribution may not necessarily affect the achievement of the\ncity goal. However, those regulations without fairness awareness\ndo so by providing unfair feedback, resulting in operators with\nhigher profits sacrificing more profits for cooperation. On the con-\ntrary, operators with lower profits sacrifice less profit. Therefore,\nthe findings in Table 2 indicate the issue of disparity in operators\u2019\ncontributions that even though the performance of REALISM w/o\nFASA in city goal achievement is close to REALISM, higher-earning\noperators (Spin and Bird) contribute more to city goals, whereas\nlower-earning ones (Lime) contribute less. This in turn, validates\nthe importance of considering fairness in scoring.5.3.3 The Impact of Different Fairness Definitions .The defi-\nnition of fairness differs in different situations [ 27]. Here we intro-\nduce a new fairness definition to evaluate how it impacts the model\nperformance. Following [ 11]. To define vehicle usage equity, we\nuse the difference between the regional demand satisfaction rate\nand the average demand satisfaction rate across all regions, aim-\ning to achieve equal satisfaction rates across all regions. To define\nscore assignment fairness, we use the difference between operator\nscores and average operator scores, aiming to achieve equal scores\nacross all the operators. They are respectively formulated as \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc62\n\ud835\udc61=\n\u22121\n\ud835\udc41\u00cd\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc56=1|\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61\u2212\u00cd\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc56=1\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61\u00cd\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc56=1\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc61|,\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc61=\u2212\u00cd\ud835\udc40\n\ud835\udc5a=1|\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61\u2212\u00cd\ud835\udc40\n\ud835\udc5a=1\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc40|. The\nnotation meanings are detailed in Section 3.\nFigure 4 and Figure 5 show the results of comparison experi-\nments with our model variant (i.e., REALISM w DFD) in terms of\nsatisfaction rates and net revenue. Specifically, each box in Figure 4\nrepresents the distribution of demand satisfaction rates across all\ncity regions, aggregated across three operators. The net revenue in\nFigure 5 is the average of the three operators. From Figure 4, we\nknow that the average regional demand satisfaction rates of the\ntwo models are nearly the same while REALISM w DFD achieves a\nsmaller fluctuation. The possible reason is that REALISM w DFD\naims to achieve equal satisfaction rates across all regions according\nto its definition of vehicle usage equity and both REALISM and\nREALISM w DFD share the same city goal of maximizing the de-\nmand satisfaction rate. However, Figure 5 reveals that REALISM\nachieves higher net revenue for operators in the city compared to\nREALISM w DFD. The possible reason is that the focus on balancing\nregional demand satisfaction may undermine the operators\u2019 profits.\nIn addition, balancing the amount of scores without accounting for\noperators\u2019 net revenue could further reduce their profits.\n/uni00000035/uni00000028/uni00000024/uni0000002f/uni0000002c/uni00000036/uni00000030 /uni00000035/uni00000028/uni00000024/uni0000002f/uni0000002c/uni00000036/uni00000030/uni00000003/uni0000005a/uni00000003/uni00000027/uni00000029/uni00000027/uni0000001b/uni00000013/uni0000001b/uni00000018/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni0000001c/uni00000018/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013 /uni00000036/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000056/uni00000049/uni00000044/uni00000046/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051/uni00000003/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni0000000b/uni00000008/uni0000000c\nFigure 4: The regional distribu-\ntion of demand satisfaction\nFigure 5: The monthly average\nnet revenue of operators\n/uni00000035/uni00000028/uni00000024/uni0000002f/uni0000002c/uni00000036/uni00000030 /uni00000036/uni00000052/uni00000037/uni00000033/uni0000001b/uni00000013/uni0000001b/uni00000018/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni0000001c/uni00000018/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013 /uni00000036/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000056/uni00000049/uni00000044/uni00000046/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051/uni00000003/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000003/uni0000000b/uni00000008/uni0000000c\nFigure 6: The distribution of\ndemand satisfaction rate in\none month\n/uni00000035/uni00000028/uni00000024/uni0000002f/uni0000002c/uni00000036/uni00000030 /uni00000036/uni00000052/uni00000037/uni00000033/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001b/uni00000014/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni00000014/uni00000011/uni00000019 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\n/uni00000028/uni00000054/uni00000058/uni0000004c/uni00000057/uni0000005c/uni00000010/uni00000053/uni00000055/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000055/uni0000004c/uni00000057/uni0000005c/uni00000003/uni00000044/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni00000044Figure 7: The distribution of\nvehicle usage equity in one\nmonth\n5.4 Case Study\nWe present a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of REAL-\nISM in achieving city goals related to both the demand satisfaction\nrate and vehicle usage equity compared to the state-of-the-practice\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nREALISM: A Regulatory Multi-Operator Shared Micromobility Vehicle Scheduling Framework SIGSPATIAL \u201925, November 3 \u2013 6, 2025, Minneapolis, MN, USA\nregulation (SoTP) used in Chicago [ 7]. Specifically, SoTP conducts\nstrict regulation by forcing a minimum number of vehicles in cer-\ntain areas (i.e., 62 equity-priority regions in Chicago covering 42.2%\nof the areas). Figure 6 illustrates the distribution of the daily demand\nsatisfaction rate in one month. It shows that compared with SoTP,\nthe flexible regulations of REALISM enable operators to achieve a\nhigher demand satisfaction rate. Figure 7 displays the distribution\nof vehicle usage equity in two categories of areas (i.e., equity prior-\nity areas and non-equity priority areas). We found that our method\nachieves a comparable good result in the equity-priority areas, with-\nout losing the flexibility of rebalancing vehicles, compared to the\nstrict number of vehicles in these regions using SoTP. In non-equity\npriority areas, our method achieves a better demand-supply ratio\n(i.e., close to one), which satisfies the most demand while resulting\nin fewer idle vehicles. This case study demonstrates the practical\nbenefits that our method can offer to cities.\n6 Discussion\nLessons : Based on the results from our work, we summarize the\nfollowing learned lessons: (i) The city regulator\u2019s regulations make\noperators aware of the achievement of city goals and collaboratively\nrealize them, as shown in Table 2. Without regulations, operators\nonly focus on maximizing their own profits, leading to worse city\ngoal achievements. (ii) The city regulator\u2019s regulations, which as-\nsign scores, should ensure fairness of the assigned scores across all\noperators, as demonstrated in Table 2. Lack of fairness consideration\ncan result in operators receiving unfair scores and consequently\nmaking unfair contributions to the city goal achievements.\nLimitations : (i) We assume that the city regulator regulates oper-\nators only in the form of score assignment. The flexible forms of\nregulations on multi-operator vehicle rebalancing will be our future\nwork. (ii) We utilize a single dataset for evaluation, as the dataset\nfrom Chicago is the only publicly available resource that offers\nspatial-temporally synchronized multi-operator data. We plan to\nextend our evaluation by incorporating additional datasets from\nmultiple cities in future work. (iii) In our paper, we aim to develop a\ngeneral regulatory framework for multi-operator shared micromo-\nbility vehicle rebalancing in a city: the city regulator regulates the\nshared micromobility operators\u2019 vehicle rebalancing in a city and\ngives feedback to each operator considering different perspectives,\nincluding demand satisfaction, vehicle usage equity, total ridership,\netc. The feedback can incentivize or punish those operators to guide\nthem to adjust their rebalancing strategies, and the feedback sent\nto each operator should be fairness-aware. Therefore, the metrics\nof vehicle usage equity and fairness of score assignment can be\nreplaced by other works (e.g., worst-case notions of fairness [ 3],\nand causal notions of fairness [ 14]). (iv) In our work, we assume\na non-competitive relationship between operators that users rely\non a single operator\u2014they do not switch between operators even\nwhen their preferred operator has insufficient supply. Under the\nassumption that users utilize services from multiple operators, the\noperators\u2019 relationship would shift to a competitive one, thereby\nimposing greater complexity and challenges for the regulatory\nframework. This is an interesting direction to explore in the future.Incentive mechanism : Even though it is ideal that the city regu-\nlator regulates operators\u2019 vehicle rebalancing in the form of incen-\ntivizing their contributions to the city goal achievement, designing a\nuniversal incentive mechanism is tough due to the challenge of mea-\nsuring operators\u2019 responses to incentives, such as their acceptance\nand preferences. Our framework allows regulators to influence op-\nerators\u2019 rebalancing strategies and automate strategy adjustments\nby incorporating monetary scores into the reinforcement learning\nprocess. Practically, rewards for meeting city goals could include\nfleet expansion, whereas failures may lead to license suspensions\n[7]. These outcomes could be translated into scores by carefully\nassessing their monetary equivalent.\nModel Generalizability : While the experimental setup is based\non Chicago\u2019s 77 regions and 3 operators, our framework is designed\nto be general and adaptable across a broad range of urban mobil-\nity settings: (i) The vehicle scheduling module in our framework\nis modular and can be replaced by different baseline algorithms,\nincluding those that handle heterogeneous fleets such as bikes and\nscooters with different operational constraints and demand dynam-\nics. (ii) The metrics used by the regulator in the score assignment\nmechanism to evaluate each operator\u2019s contribution toward city\ngoal achievement are also replaceable. In addition, those metrics are\nmodular and can be tailored to reflect local regulations, geographic\ncontexts, or the specific characteristics of scheduled vehicle types in\ndifferent cities. (iii) Our framework supports dynamic adjustment\nin the number of operators, and its underlying mechanisms remain\neffective regardless of the scale.\n7 Related Work\nMulti-fleet management aims to achieve cost savings and superior\nservice quality by efficiently managing a variety of vehicle fleets.\nExisting works can be divided into two categories, including (i)\ncooperative-based multi-fleet management and (ii) non-cooperative-\nbased multi-fleet management.\nIn the cooperative paradigm, one solution involves establish-\ning multiple agents to control the fleet. Some studies assume a\nunified objective among all fleets, collectively striving towards\nits attainment [ 12,16,24,25,29,31,32,36,38,39]. For example,\nRECOMMEND [ 31] views each region as an agent responsible for\nrebalancing and charging shared electric micromobility vehicles.\nThese agents share information and are dedicated to a common\ngoal: finding the optimal charging and rebalancing strategies that\nmaximize the platform\u2019s benefits. MAGC [ 38] aims to solve the\ncharging station request-specific dynamic pricing problem. They\nregard each charging station as an agent and consider the com-\nplex, competitive, and cooperative relationships between different\nagents to maximize operator benefits through vehicle scheduling.\nHowever, in practice, this assumption often falters since operators\nhave divergent objectives driven by their individual profit motives,\nwhich render these cooperative approaches less applicable. Another\nsolution is to establish a central controller to facilitate collaboration.\nKondor et al. [12] control agents in an intrusive way by directly in-\nfluencing their decision-making. However, it may not be applicable\nfor our work as operators might not fully adhere to directives from\nsuch a centralized entity and tend to retain control of their fleets.\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nSIGSPATIAL \u201925, November 3 \u2013 6, 2025, Minneapolis, MN, USA Heng Tan, Hua Yan, Yukun Yuan, Guang Wang, and Yu Yang\nIn addition, the setting of the single control agent may introduce a\nlarge action and state space, which is computationally intractable.\nIn the non-cooperative-based methods, they establish multiple\nagents to manage the fleet, with each agent pursuing its own objec-\ntives and striving to maximize its individual goals [ 15,17,33\u201335,40].\nFor example, Record [ 34] designs a dynamic deadline-based dis-\ntributed deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the most\nsuitable service station for relocation and the optimal charging\nstation for each shared electric vehicle. They consider each unoccu-\npied shared electric vehicle as an agent and enable it to maximize its\nown objectives. STMIP [ 15] considers the shared bike rebalancing\nproblem as a truck-based rebalancing problem and models it as a\nspatial-temporal mixed integer programming problem. However,\ndue to the absence of central regulation, their frameworks make\nagents unable to communicate with each other and achieve the\ncollaborative goal.\n8 Conclusion\nIn this work, we focus on the problem of multi-operator vehicle\nscheduling under the regulation set by the city regulator. We design\na MARL-based framework called REALISM, which incorporates a\nfairness-aware score assignment prediction model to regulate oper-\nators\u2019 vehicle rebalancing. In REALISM, we utilize an alternating\nprocedure to optimize both the vehicle rebalancing agents and the\nscore assignment prediction model. The evaluation results demon-\nstrate that REALISM achieves an improvement of at least 39.93% in\nvehicle usage equity and 1.82% in the average demand satisfaction\nacross the whole city, compared to state-of-the-art baselines.\n9 Acknowledgement\nThis work was supported in part by NSF grants 2246080, 2318697,\nand 2427915.
